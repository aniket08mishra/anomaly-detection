Introduction
Anomaly detection is a machine learning technique used to identify irregularities in data that deviate from normal patterns. These irregularities, known as anomalies or outliers, may indicate errors, fraud, or unusual occurrences that require further investigation. Anomaly detection is applied across various fields, including finance, cybersecurity, healthcare, and predictive maintenance. Different methods exist for detecting anomalies, such as statistical techniques, clustering algorithms, and deep learning models.

Common methods for anomaly detection include Principal Component Analysis (PCA), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Isolation Forest, and ensemble techniques. In deep learning, one popular approach is using Autoencoders, which are neural networks trained to compress and reconstruct data. Autoencoders are trained on normal, non-anomalous data and later used to detect anomalies when the reconstruction of new data deviates from expected patterns. Evaluating anomaly detection models is challenging since anomalies are rare and often underrepresented in training data. Standard evaluation metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and cross-validation help assess model performance on unseen data.

Why Not PCA?
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a popular dimensionality reduction technique that transforms high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving most of the original variation. It identifies principal components, which are the directions in which data shows the most variance. These components are orthogonal to each other, with the first component capturing the highest variation.

PCA can be used for anomaly detection, but it has limitations. It assumes that the data has a linear structure and that the principal components capture meaningful features. For highly nonlinear or complex data, PCA may not be effective. Additionally, rare anomalies may be overlooked if the normal patterns dominate the data, making PCA less suitable for such tasks.

Autoencoders: The Better Alternative
Autoencoders are neural networks designed for unsupervised learning, dimensionality reduction, and data compression. The goal of an autoencoder is to learn an efficient, compressed representation of input data by encoding it into a lower-dimensional form and then decoding it back to reconstruct the original data.

An autoencoder has three main components:

Encoder: Compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional representation.
Hidden Layer (Code): Contains the compressed representation of the input.
Decoder: Reconstructs the original data from the compressed form.
During training, the autoencoder minimizes the difference between the input and the reconstructed output, enabling it to capture complex, nonlinear relationships in the data. This makes autoencoders well-suited for applications like image compression, anomaly detection, and data generation.

For anomaly detection, the autoencoder is trained on normal data to learn typical patterns and relationships. New data points can be encoded and compared to the expected reconstruction. If the reconstruction error exceeds a certain threshold, the data point is flagged as an anomaly. This unsupervised approach allows autoencoders to detect anomalies without requiring explicit labeling in the training data.
